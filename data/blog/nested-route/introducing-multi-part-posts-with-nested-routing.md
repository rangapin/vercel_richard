# What is Laravel?

If you are looking for a framework that is easy to use and offers a lot of features, Laravel is the way to go. Laravel is a free, open-source PHP framework that provides expressive, elegant syntax for developing web applications. Laravel was created by Taylor Otwell in 2011 and has since grown to be one of the most popular PHP frameworks currently in use today.

# Introduction to the Framework

Laravel has an expressive, elegant syntax that makes it easy to write beautiful, clean code. Laravel also offers out-of-the-box support for many features of modern web development such as routing, authentication, sessions, and more.

# Installing Laravel on Your System

Laravel has a large community of developers and contributors, which means it will always be updated with the latest features and bug fixes. It also has an excellent documentation, which makes it easier to learn how to use the framework. Installing Laravel on your system is not difficult at all. All you need is a web server with PHP 5.6 or higher and Composer installed on your system. You can then download the latest version of Laravel from its website.
